		<h2>It's Always Sunny in Danny's America</h2><p>Danny DeVito has spent his career making people laugh and smile. In a predictable turn of events, he has decided to run for President of the United States of America. His experience in a variety of different roles in cinema have prepared him well to rise and deliver his best performance yet.</p></br><p>Originally from New Jersey, Danny has gone a long way from home to pursue his various talents. Among his experience, he carries the titles of Actor, Director, Producer, and Screenwritor. The man knows how to convey powerful messages to the masses. He has played roles in comedies, dramas, thrillers, children's movies, and much more that have sufficiently prepared him to take on any type of problem as President. This is who we need in the highest office of the nation. Someone to make you laugh, someone to sympathize with you in your lows, someone who can keep cool in stressful situations, someone who can tolerate children and kiss the babies in photo ops. Danny is all of these things, and he wants YOU to help him get to the position where he can help US.</p></br><h2>Join the fight, Make America Sunny Again</h2>
